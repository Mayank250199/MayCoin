Creating blockchain and implement Proof-of-Work

# BlockChain
A blockchain,originally block chain,is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
which are linked and secured using cryptography.Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,
a timestamp and transaction data.

# Block
Blocks are files where bitcoin network data is permanently recorded. 
A block records recent bitcoin transactions, and serves a similar purpose as a ledger page or record book.

# Proof-of-Work
A proof of work is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to
produce but easy for others to verify and which satisfies certain requirements.
Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error 
is required on average before a valid proof of work is generated. 

# To Run
->TO run first install node dependenciesby using command (npm install)

->To create Blocks run command (node main.js)

->To implement Proof of Work run command (node proof.js)
